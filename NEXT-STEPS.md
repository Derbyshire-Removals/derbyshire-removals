# Next Steps for Completing the Eleventy Migration

We've set up the foundation for migrating your Next.js/React website to Eleventy. Here's what we've accomplished so far and what needs to be done next.

## What's Been Done

1. **Project Structure**: Created the basic Eleventy project structure with appropriate directories
2. **Configuration**: Set up Eleventy and Tailwind CSS configuration
3. **Base Templates**: Created the base layout template with header and footer
4. **Homepage**: Migrated the homepage with all its components
5. **Key Pages**: Migrated several important pages:
   - About Us
   - Contact
   - Storage
   - Move Checklist
   - Areas We Cover
   - House Removals service page
6. **JavaScript**: Set up vanilla JavaScript for handling interactive elements
7. **Migration Tools**: Created a migration script and guide

## What Needs to Be Done

### 1. Deployment Setup

Set up the deployment process for GitHub Pages:

- Configure the deploy script in package.json
- Set up GitHub repository settings for GitHub Pages
- Test the deployment process

### 2. Copy and Optimize Assets

- Copy all images from the Next.js public directory
- Optimize images for web performance
- Ensure all assets are properly referenced in the new templates

### 3. Form Handling

- Set up form submission handling for contact forms
- Implement form validation
- Connect to your existing form submission endpoint or service

### 4. Testing and Refinement

- Test all pages on various devices and browsers
- Check for any broken links or missing content
- Ensure all interactive elements work correctly
- Run performance tests and make optimizations

### 5. SEO and Analytics

- Verify all metadata is correctly implemented
- Set up analytics tracking
- Create a sitemap.xml file
- Implement any additional SEO features

### 6. Deployment

- Set up your hosting platform (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
- Configure build settings
- Set up any necessary redirects
- Deploy the site

## How to Use the Migration Tools

### Migration Script

The `migrate.js` script helps automate the migration process:

```bash
node migrate.js
```

This will:
1. Create the Eleventy project structure
2. Copy configuration files
3. Copy source files and templates
4. Copy public assets
5. Install dependencies

### Migration Guide

The `MIGRATION-GUIDE.md` file provides a detailed checklist and reference for the migration process. Use it to track your progress and ensure all aspects of the site are migrated correctly.

## Running the Eleventy Site

To run the Eleventy development server:

```bash
# Navigate to the Eleventy project directory
cd eleventy-site

# Install dependencies (if not done by the migration script)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

The site will be available at http://localhost:8080.

## Building for Production

To build the site for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the static site in the `dist` directory, ready for deployment.
