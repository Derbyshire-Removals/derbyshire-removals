        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Packing is usually the most time-consuming part of moving. It’s also where most accidental damage happens—using the wrong box,
          under-protecting fragile items, or overloading cartons. With our professional packers, you get an organised, room-by-room pack that
          keeps items protected and easy to unpack.
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Save time:</strong> packing that might take days can often be completed in a single planned visit.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduced stress:</strong> fewer last-minute jobs and a clearer moving plan.</li>
          <li><strong>Safer handling:</strong> the right box sizes, padding, and wrapping techniques for each item type.</li>
          <li><strong>Better organisation:</strong> labelled boxes and optional inventory notes for priority rooms.</li>
          <li><strong>Fragile-item expertise:</strong> glassware, artwork, mirrors, electronics, and awkward shapes packed correctly.</li>
        </ul>

          We tailor the pack to your home, timeline, and the level of help you want. Some customers prefer a full pack; others only need
          support with breakables or a few rooms. Either way, our team arrives with the right materials and a clear plan.

          Our process is simple, consistent, and designed to keep things moving smoothly—especially on busy moving weeks. We’ll confirm access,
          priorities, and any items that need special attention (like artwork, mirrors, or electronics). Then we pack methodically, room by room.
