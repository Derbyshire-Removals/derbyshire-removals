        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Every home move is different—terraced houses with tight access, flats with stairs, or family homes with bulky furniture and fragile items.
          Our approach is simple: plan well, protect everything properly, and keep you informed at each stage. If you need extra support,
          we can also provide <a href="/packaging-material/" class="text-[#071059] underline hover:no-underline">removal packing supplies</a> and
          practical guidance so you feel ready long before moving day arrives.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-0">
          We also support moves that need coordination beyond transport—such as short-term storage, staged packing, or flexible time slots.

          A smooth move is built on a repeatable process. Here’s how we deliver <strong>house removals Derbyshire</strong> customers recommend:
        </p>

        <div class="space-y-6">
          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1) Quote & planning</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-0">
              Tell us where you’re moving from and to, your preferred dates, and any tricky items (pianos, large sofas, fragile collections).
              We’ll confirm access, parking, and how much help you’d like with packing. Then we’ll provide a clear, no-nonsense quote.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2) Packing & protection (optional)</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-0">
              If you’d like help, we can pack all or part of your home. We use appropriate materials for different items—strong boxes for books,
              protective wrap for glassware, and padded covers for furniture. Prefer DIY? You can still use our
              <a href="/packaging-material/" class="text-[#071059] underline hover:no-underline">packing materials</a> to keep everything consistent and secure.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3) Loading day</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-0">
              We arrive on time, protect high-traffic areas where needed, and load strategically so items stay stable in the vehicle.
              Fragile and high-value items are handled with extra care. We also keep essentials accessible so you’re not rummaging through boxes.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4) Transport & delivery</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-0">
              Your belongings are secured for transit, then unloaded room-by-room at your new address. If you want, we can place furniture where it’s needed
              (within reason) so you can start living comfortably right away.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5) After-move support</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-0">
              If you’re unpacking slowly or renovating, we can discuss short-term storage options. For a helpful moving-day timeline,
              our <a href="/move-checklist/" class="text-[#071059] underline hover:no-underline">moving house checklist</a> keeps you organised before, during and after your move.

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">How much does house removal cost in Derbyshire?</h3>
            <p class="mb-0">
              Costs depend on home size, distance, access, the number of movers required, and whether you add packing or storage.
              The best way to get an accurate figure is to request a quote with your move details.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">How far in advance should I book?</h3>
            <p class="mb-0">
              Weekends and end-of-month dates fill up quickly. If you can, book as soon as your moving date is likely—then we can hold the slot
              and confirm details as your plans firm up.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">Are my belongings insured?</h3>
            <p class="mb-0">
              We operate with insurance in place. Cover levels can vary depending on the service and item type, so we’ll explain what’s included
              and any optional enhancements during your quote.

          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">What should I pack first?</h3>
            <p class="mb-0">
              Start with non-essentials: out-of-season clothes, books, décor, and rarely-used kitchenware. Keep a clearly labelled essentials box
              for the first night (chargers, toiletries, kettle, mugs, medication, documents).

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">Can you help with packing and materials?</h3>
            <p class="mb-0">
              Yes—choose full packing, part packing, or materials-only. Many customers combine our service with
              <a href="/packaging-material/" class="text-[#071059] underline hover:no-underline">removal packing supplies</a> so everything is uniform and sturdy.
