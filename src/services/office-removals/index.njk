          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1) Survey & planning</h3>
            <p class="mb-0">
              We start with a quick consultation (and site visit where needed). We confirm access, lift/stair routes, loading areas,
              parking restrictions, and any building management requirements. This is where we decide on crew size, vehicle size,
              and your ideal move window.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2) Labelling & departmental structure</h3>
            <p class="mb-0">
              Office moves are smoother when items land in the right place. We recommend a simple labelling system:
              department → room/zone → desk number. If you’re doing a staged relocation, we’ll also define “go-live” priorities
              so essential teams are up and running first.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3) Packing & protection</h3>
            <p class="mb-0">
              We can supply crates/boxes and protective materials, or your team can pre-pack with guidance. Sensitive items like
              screens, PCs, and servers are packed with extra protection and loaded with stability in mind. If you want to source supplies,
              see our <a href="/packaging-material/" class="text-[#071059] underline hover:no-underline">packing materials</a>.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4) Move execution (out-of-hours available)</h3>
            <p class="mb-0">
              On moving day, we follow the agreed load plan and keep a clear chain of communication. For larger relocations,
              we can run phased moves to keep certain teams working while other zones are relocated.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5) Placement & setup support</h3>
            <p class="mb-0">
              We place items into the right rooms/zones so unpacking is quick. If furniture needs basic reassembly, we can help coordinate
              so your team can get back to normal operations sooner.

            <p class="mb-0">
              Yes. We regularly move monitors, desktops, printers, and other sensitive equipment. If you have a server room or specialist hardware,

            <p class="mb-0">
              Timing depends on access, load size, distance, and whether packing is included. Smaller offices can often be completed in a day,
              while multi-floor relocations may be staged over evenings/weekends to reduce disruption.
