        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-[#071059]">Types of Packaging Materials</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The best packing materials do two jobs: they protect your belongings and they make loading/unloading more efficient.
          Using the right <strong>packaging materials Derbyshire</strong> customers rely on—strong boxes, proper wrapping, and clear labels—can reduce breakages,
          prevent scuffs on furniture, and save time on moving day.
        </p>

        <div class="space-y-7 text-gray-700">
          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#071059] mb-2">Moving boxes (small, medium, large)</h3>
            <p class="mb-2">
              Boxes are the foundation of any safe move. Small and medium boxes are ideal for heavy items like books, files, and tools,
              while large boxes work best for light bulky items such as bedding, cushions, and kitchen plastics.
            </p>
            <p>
              For removals, we recommend packing by room and writing <strong>room + contents + priority</strong> on every box.
              That simple system helps you find essentials quickly and lets the unloading team place boxes in the right rooms first time.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#071059] mb-2">Wardrobe cartons for hanging clothes</h3>
            <p>
              Wardrobe cartons keep shirts, dresses, and coats on hangers so they arrive crease-free. They’re also a huge time-saver:
              no folding, no bin-bags, and you can hang items straight into your new wardrobe. If you’re moving a lot of hanging clothes,
              adding even a couple of wardrobes can make packing feel much easier.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#071059] mb-2">Protective wrap for fragile items</h3>
            <p class="mb-2">
              Bubble wrap and packing paper are essential for glassware, ceramics, ornaments, and framed items.
              Packing paper is clean and ink-free, making it ideal for wrapping plates and cups without leaving marks.
            </p>
            <p>
              A practical approach is “wrap, cushion, then fill gaps”: wrap the item, place it in a box with padding underneath,
              and fill empty space so nothing shifts during transit. Mark boxes as <strong>Fragile</strong> and keep them upright.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#071059] mb-2">Packing tape, fragile tape, and markers</h3>
            <p>
              Strong tape keeps boxes secure while they’re being stacked and moved. Fragile tape is useful for quick visual identification
              of delicate boxes. A good marker pen is underrated—clear labels reduce confusion on moving day and help you unpack faster.
              If you only do one “packing upgrade,” label every box on at least two sides.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#071059] mb-2">Furniture protection: shrink wrap and mattress covers</h3>
            <p class="mb-2">
              Shrink wrap is great for keeping drawers closed, bundling awkward items together, and protecting surfaces from dust and light scuffs.
              Mattress covers protect against moisture and marks while moving in and out of vans, hallways, and stairwells.
            </p>
            <p>
              These are particularly helpful for longer-distance moves, shared access buildings, or when weather is unpredictable.

      <section class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-8 mb-8">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-[#071059]">Eco-Friendly Options</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          If you want to reduce waste, there are several eco-friendly packing choices that still provide strong protection.
          Many customers looking for <strong>packaging materials Derbyshire</strong> also ask for greener alternatives—these are the easiest wins.
        </p>

        <div class="space-y-5 text-gray-700">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#071059] mb-2">Bio bubble wrap and recyclable paper</h3>
          <p>
            Bio bubble wrap provides cushioning similar to standard bubble wrap but is designed with sustainability in mind.
            Packing paper is widely recyclable and works well for wrapping and void-fill.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#071059] mb-2">Reuse what you already have</h3>
          <p>
            You can cut down on packaging by using towels, blankets, and clothing to wrap non-fragile items.
            This also saves space in boxes and keeps soft furnishings useful during the move.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#071059] mb-2">Right-size your materials</h3>
          <p>
            Overpacking large boxes leads to splits and damaged items. Using the correct box size reduces wasted materials (and time).
            Small boxes for heavy items, large boxes for light items, and clearly labelled essentials.
          </p>
        </div>

      <section class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-8 mb-10">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-[#071059]">Specialised Packing Supplies</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Some items benefit from specialist protection. If you have lots of fragile décor, valuable electronics, or bulky furniture,
          ask about the best <strong>removal packing supplies</strong> for those items so they arrive safely.
        </p>

        <div class="space-y-5 text-gray-700">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#071059] mb-2">Electronics and screens</h3>
          <p>
            TVs and monitors should be kept upright and protected from pressure. If original packaging isn’t available,
            use thick wrapping and ensure the item can’t flex or move inside the box/blanket wrap.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#071059] mb-2">Glass, mirrors, and picture frames</h3>
          <p>
            Use protective wrap, add corner protection where possible, and keep these items upright.
            Avoid stacking heavy boxes on top and clearly label boxes so they’re handled correctly.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#071059] mb-2">“Open first” essentials (Bitz box)</h3>
          <p>
            Your essentials box is the last one loaded and the first one unloaded—chargers, keys, kettle, tea/coffee, toiletries,
            basic tools, and important documents. It prevents the classic first-night scramble.
