        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#071059]">Benefits of Our Packing Services</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Packing is one of the most time-consuming parts of any move. It’s also where damage usually happens—boxes are overfilled, fragile items shift,
          and essentials disappear into the wrong room. A professional packing team removes that stress and adds structure to the entire move.
        </p>

        <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Save days of time:</strong> We pack efficiently, so you don’t lose evenings and weekends to boxes and tape.</li>
          <li><strong>Protect fragile items properly:</strong> Glassware, ornaments, pictures, TVs, and mirrors are wrapped, cushioned, and boxed with care.</li>
          <li><strong>Clear labelling for faster unpacking:</strong> Boxes are labelled by room and contents, making unloading and settling in far easier.</li>
          <li><strong>Less moving-day chaos:</strong> A consistent packing system stacks better in the van and reduces shifting in transit.</li>
          <li><strong>Flexible options:</strong> Choose full packing, part packing (kitchen/loft/garage), or fragile-only packing depending on budget and needs.</li>
          <li><strong>Peace of mind:</strong> You’ll know what’s packed, where it’s going, and how it’s protected—especially useful for busy families and time-sensitive moves.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-8 mb-8">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#071059]">How Our Packing Process Works</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          We keep our process simple and predictable. You’ll know what’s included, how long it’s likely to take, and what you need to do beforehand
          (usually very little). Our goal is to make moving day calmer and safer by packing in a logical, room-by-room way.
        </p>

        <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-700">
          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1) Quick quote and packing plan</h3>
            <p>
              We start by confirming what you need packed—everything, selected rooms, or fragile items only. We also note access details (stairs, parking,
              tight hallways) and any items that need special attention (artwork, antiques, instruments, electronics). If you have a completion date or key
              collection time, we plan around it.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2) We supply suitable materials</h3>
            <p>
              Using the right materials prevents crushed boxes, split seams, and transit damage. We use strong cartons, packing paper, bubble wrap, wardrobe
              boxes, shrink wrap, tape, and protective covers. We also balance box weight so lifting is safer and stacks remain stable.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3) Room-by-room packing with smart labelling</h3>
            <p>
              We pack one room at a time to keep items grouped logically. Each box is labelled for the destination room (e.g., “Kitchen”, “Main Bedroom”)
              plus a short content note (e.g., “Pans”, “Books”, “Ornaments”). This makes unloading quicker and reduces the “where did we put it?” problem.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4) Fragile items packed for real-world moving</h3>
            <p>
              Fragile packing isn’t just “wrap and hope.” We wrap items individually, cushion gaps to stop movement, and avoid mixing heavy objects with
              delicate ones. Glass, ceramics, and ornaments are boxed with padding and marked clearly. Mirrors and pictures are protected at edges and corners.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5) Final checks and moving-day coordination</h3>
            <p>
              Before we finish, we confirm essential items are set aside (documents, medication, valuables) and that key boxes are easy to access.
              If we’re also handling removals, our packing system supports safer loading and fewer issues in transit.
              If you need storage between dates, we can help—see our <a href="/storage/" class="text-[#071059] underline">Storage</a> options.

        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-6">
          Many customers choose a blended approach: we handle the kitchen, fragile items, and difficult rooms (lofts/garages), while they pack clothes and
          everyday items. This keeps costs sensible and reduces risk where it matters most—especially on tight timelines.
          Mid-way through your planning, it’s worth revisiting your essentials list and move timing using our

        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
          If you’re comparing options, our <strong>Packing Services Derbyshire</strong> can be booked as a standalone service or combined with removals.
          Either way, you’ll get an organised approach that protects your belongings and makes the whole move feel more manageable.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What does the packing service include?</h3>
            <p>
              Our packing service includes supplying appropriate materials, packing items room-by-room, labelling boxes clearly, and taking extra care with fragile items.
              You can choose full packing, part packing, or fragile-only packing depending on what you need.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Can you pack fragile items only?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. Fragile-only packing is a popular option for kitchens, ornaments, pictures, mirrors, and electronics. It’s ideal if you want professional protection
              for delicate belongings but prefer to pack clothes and everyday items yourself.

            <p>
              The earlier the better—especially for weekends and month-end dates. If your move date is close, contact us anyway and we’ll advise availability.

            <p>
              We recommend setting aside items you’re taking personally (documents, valuables, medication) and pointing out anything you don’t want packed.
              Otherwise, you don’t need to prepare much—we bring materials and handle the packing.
