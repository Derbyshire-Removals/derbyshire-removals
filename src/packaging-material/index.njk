        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#071059]">Benefits of Our Packing Services</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Packing looks simple until you’re living among half-filled boxes, you can’t find essentials, and you’re worried about breakables.
          A professional packing service removes the stress and reduces the risk of damage. Here’s what our customers typically value most:
        </p>

        <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Time back in your week:</strong> We pack efficiently and methodically, so you don’t lose evenings and weekends to boxes.</li>
          <li><strong>Better protection for fragile items:</strong> Glassware, TVs, mirrors and ornaments are wrapped and boxed using the right materials and techniques.</li>
          <li><strong>Clear labelling and room planning:</strong> We label by room and contents, so unloading and unpacking is smoother.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduced “moving day chaos”:</strong> When everything is packed consistently, it stacks better in the van and is easier to handle.</li>
          <li><strong>Flexible options:</strong> Choose full packing, fragile-only packing, or a part-pack for kitchens, lofts, garages, or high-risk items.</li>
        </ul>

          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Mid-move tip: if you’re combining packing with removals, book both together so the packing plan matches your moving schedule.
            You can browse our <a href="/removals/" class="text-[#071059] underline">Removals Services</a> and keep everything with one team.

      <!-- PROCESS -->
      <section class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-8 mb-8">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#071059]">How Our Packing Process Works</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          We keep packing straightforward. You’ll know what’s happening, what’s included, and what you need to do (usually very little).
          Our process is built to protect your belongings and keep your move on schedule.
        </p>

        <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-700">
          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1) Quick call and packing plan</h3>
            <p>
              We’ll confirm what you want packed (everything or selected rooms/items), any access details, and any special requirements
              like antiques, artwork, instruments, or awkward furniture. If you’ve got deadlines (completion times, key collection),
              we plan around them.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2) We bring the right materials</h3>
            <p>
              Strong boxes, paper, bubble wrap, shrink wrap, and protective covers—plus wardrobe cartons for hanging clothes.
              Using the right materials matters because overfilled boxes split, and underpacked boxes crush. We balance weight,
              protect edges, and keep items stable during transit.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3) Room-by-room packing (with smart labelling)</h3>
            <p>
              We pack one room at a time so items stay grouped logically. Each box is labelled for room destination and general contents
              (for example, “Kitchen – pans” or “Bedroom 2 – books”). This is one of the biggest reasons customers say unpacking feels easier.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4) Fragile packing done properly</h3>
            <p>
              We wrap glass and ceramics individually, cushion gaps to stop movement, and avoid “mixed fragile boxes” where heavy items
              sit on delicate ones. TVs and monitors are protected for transit, and mirrors/frames are wrapped with corner protection.
              If you’d like guidance on what to keep with you (documents, jewellery), we’ll advise.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5) Moving day coordination</h3>
            <p>
              If we’re also handling removals, the packing approach feeds into loading: heavy items and stable stacks first, fragile items
              secured last with appropriate positioning. This reduces shifting and helps keep damage risk low.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What does the packing service include?</h3>
            <p>
              We supply appropriate packing materials, pack items room-by-room, label boxes clearly, and take extra care with fragile belongings.
              You can choose full packing or fragile-only packing depending on budget and how much help you want.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Can you pack fragile items only?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. Fragile-only packing is popular for kitchens, ornaments, mirrors, pictures, and electronics. It’s a cost-effective way to reduce
              damage risk while you handle the rest.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">How far in advance should I book?</h3>
            <p>
              As soon as you have a realistic moving window. Weekends and month-end dates fill up quickly. If you need urgent help, contact us and we’ll
              do our best to fit you in.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Do I need to do anything before you arrive?</h3>
            <p>
              Not much. If you can, separate items you’re taking personally (documents, jewellery, medication) and let us know about any “do not pack” items.
              We’ll handle the rest.
