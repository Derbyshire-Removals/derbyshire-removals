        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#071059]">Why professional packing makes moving easier</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Packing is often the most time-consuming part of moving. It’s not just putting items into boxes — it’s choosing the right
          materials, protecting fragile belongings, keeping rooms organised, and making sure the removal team can load and unload
          efficiently. A well-packed home reduces breakages, speeds up loading, and makes the first night in your new place far less chaotic.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Our packing team works across Derbyshire and surrounding areas, helping customers who want:
          less stress, fewer trips to the shops for supplies, and confidence that valuables are protected properly. We’re also happy to coordinate
          with your moving date and any storage needs — if you’re using temporary storage, we can pack with longer-term protection in mind.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700">
          If you’re planning a full move, you can combine packing with our removal option for a simpler experience.
          Explore <a href="/services/" class="text-[#071059] underline">our removals services</a> or ask about combining packing and transport in your quote.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Benefits of Our Packing Services</h2>

        <div class="space-y-5 text-white/95">
          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1) Better protection for fragile and valuable items</h3>
            <p>
              We use the right combination of wrapping, cushioning, and boxing techniques for glassware, electronics, artwork, and sentimental items.
              Fragile boxes are clearly marked and stacked safely, reducing the chance of damage in transit.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2) Faster loading and unloading</h3>
            <p>
              Well-packed boxes are consistent, stackable, and labelled by room — so the team can load efficiently and place items into the right rooms
              at your new property. That means fewer hold-ups on moving day.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3) Save time and energy</h3>
            <p>
              Packing always takes longer than expected. With professional support, you can focus on the rest of the move: keys, utilities, paperwork,
              and family logistics — while we handle the packing workload.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4) Flexible options: full, part, or fragile-only</h3>
            <p>
              Not everyone needs a full pack. We can pack the kitchen and breakables, help with lofts/garages, or handle only the items you’re worried about.
              Your quote reflects what you actually need.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5) Packing that suits storage or long-distance moves</h3>
            <p>
              If your items are going into storage, we’ll pack with longer-term protection in mind. If you’re moving further afield, we’ll pack to reduce
              movement and vibration. Need storage as part of your plan? Ask about our <a class="underline" href="/storage/">storage solutions</a>.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 text-[#071059]">How Our Packing Process Works</h2>

        <ol class="space-y-5 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Step 1: Quick quote and packing plan</h3>
            <p>
              Tell us what you need: full house packing, partial packing, fragile-only, or a specific room (like the kitchen).
              We’ll discuss timings, access, and anything unusual (large mirrors, antiques, tight staircases, parking).
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Step 2: Materials and protection strategy</h3>
            <p>
              We arrive with suitable materials (boxes, paper, wrap, tape, labels). Fragile items are wrapped individually, and we use the right box sizes
              to avoid overloading. Heavier items go into smaller boxes for safer lifting.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Step 3: Room-by-room packing and clear labels</h3>
            <p>
              We pack methodically so rooms stay organised. Boxes are labelled by room and contents type (e.g., “Kitchen – Glassware”), helping you unpack faster.
              If you have priorities (kids’ rooms first, home office essentials kept accessible), we’ll follow your preferences.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Step 4: Moving-day coordination</h3>
            <p>
              If we’re also handling the removal, packing ties directly into loading and transport. If another mover is involved, we can still pack and prepare
              items ready for collection, including “do not load” items if needed.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Step 5: Optional unpacking help</h3>
            <p>
              Want a quicker settle-in? Ask about unpacking support for essential rooms (kitchen, bedrooms) and removal of packing waste.
              It’s a popular option for families and busy professionals.
            </p>

            Mid-move tip: if you’re doing any DIY packing, focus on out-of-season items first and keep a clearly labelled “first night” box.

        <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-700">
          <div>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">What does the packing service include?</h3>
            <p>
              We provide the labour and packing know-how, plus suitable materials (boxes, wrap, tape, labels). We can pack a whole property
              or focus on specific rooms or fragile items — whatever you choose in your quote.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Do you offer a fragile-only packing service?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. Fragile-only is a popular option for kitchens, ornaments, mirrors, artwork, and electronics — especially if you’re happy
              to pack clothes and general items yourself.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">How far in advance should I book?</h3>
            <p>
              Earlier is always better, especially for end-of-month or weekend moves. If your move date is close, still get in touch — we’ll
              do our best to accommodate.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Will you label boxes by room?</h3>
            <p>
              Absolutely. Clear labelling is part of an efficient move. We label by room and item type to help loading and make unpacking simpler.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Can you pack for storage?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. If items are going into storage, we’ll pack to reduce moisture exposure and movement, and we’ll advise on what should stay accessible.
              See <a href="/storage/" class="text-[#071059] underline">storage solutions</a> if you need space between homes.

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">How do you price packing services?</h3>
            <p>
              Pricing depends on the size of the property, how much needs packing, access/parking, and whether you want full packing, part packing,
              or fragile-only. The fastest way is to request a quote with your move date and property details.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Are you insured while packing?</h3>
            <p>
              We operate professionally and take care with every item. If you have high-value items, tell us in advance so we can pack and handle them appropriately
              and confirm the best approach for your move.
