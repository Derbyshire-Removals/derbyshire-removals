## Benefits of the Migration

The Eleventy version of your site offers several advantages:

1. **Significantly reduced JavaScript**: The site now sends minimal JavaScript to the browser, focusing only on essential interactivity.

2. **Faster loading**: Without React's hydration process, pages load and become interactive much faster.

3. **Improved SEO**: Better Core Web Vitals scores will likely improve search rankings.

4. **Simpler maintenance**: The codebase is now more straightforward with clear separation of content and presentation.
